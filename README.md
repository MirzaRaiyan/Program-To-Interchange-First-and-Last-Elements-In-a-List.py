 About Interchange Of First and Last Elements
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples:

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]
Approach #1: Find the length of the list and simply swap the first element with (n-1)th element.
